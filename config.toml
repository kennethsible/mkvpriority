# === Input Directories ===
# List of directories to scan recursively for MKV files.
# You can add multiple paths, including network paths.
input_dirs = []


# === Audio Operation Mode ===
# Determines how the selected audio track will be flagged in the MKV:
# - 'default' = Sets the chosen track as default (recommended for most players)
# - 'forced'  = Stronger flag; some players prioritize forced tracks
# - 'disable' = Disables only non-selected tracks for unwanted languages
# - 'enable'  = Re-enables tracks previously disabled (used to undo 'disable')
#
# Recommended: ["default", "disable"]
# Sets the best-scoring audio track as default and disables unwanted, non-selected tracks.
# Keeps English dubs available for dual-audio use. Most players won't respect disabled.
audio_mode = ["default", "disable"]


# === Subtitle Operation Mode ===
# Similar to audio_mode, this controls subtitle flags:
# - 'default' = Sets the preferred subtitle as the default track
# - 'forced'  = Additionally flags it as "forced" so players will display it automatically
#
# Recommended: ["default", "forced"]
# This helps ensure subtitles are shown even if the player isn't configured properly.
subtitle_mode = ["default", "forced"]


# === Audio Language Preferences ===
# Language ranking for audio tracks. Higher values are better.
# Default: prioritize Japanese audio, with English dubs as a fallback.

# === Audio Codec Priorities ===
# Score audio codecs by quality. Higher values are better.
# This helps pick higher fidelity audio when multiple options exist.

# === Audio Channel Priorities ===
# Prefer audio with more channels (e.g. 5.1 surround over stereo).

# === Track Filters (Subtitle Naming Heuristics) ===
# Looks at the track *name* to detect its purpose and assign priority.
# This is especially useful when language or codec alone isn't enough.

# - Signs & Songs (for English Dubs)
# - Commentary/SDH (which should be ranked last)

# === Subtitle Codec Preferences ===
# Ranks subtitle formats by display quality and stylability.
