# === Input Directories ===
# List of directories to scan recursively for MKV files.
# You can add multiple paths, including network paths.
input_dirs = []


# === Audio Operation Mode ===
# Determines how the selected audio track will be flagged in the MKV:
# - 'default' = Sets the chosen track as default (recommended for most players)
# - 'forced'  = Stronger flag; some players prioritize forced tracks
# - 'disabled' = Disables non-selected tracks (ignored by most players)
# - 'enabled'  = Re-enables tracks previously disabled (used to undo 'disabled')
#
# Recommended: ["default"]
# Sets the best-scoring audio track as default and disables non-selected tracks.

# === Subtitle Operation Mode ===
# Similar to audio_mode, this controls subtitle flags:
# - 'default' = Sets the chosen track as default (recommended for most players)
# - 'forced'  = Stronger flag; some players prioritize forced tracks
# - 'disabled' = Disables non-selected tracks (ignored by most players)
# - 'enabled'  = Re-enables tracks previously disabled (used to undo 'disabled')
#
# Recommended: ["default", "forced"]
# This helps ensure subtitles are shown even if the player isn't configured properly.

# === Audio Language Preferences ===
# Language ranking for audio tracks. Higher values are better.
# Default: prioritize Japanese audio, with English dubs as a fallback.
