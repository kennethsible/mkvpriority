# === Media Directories ===
# List of directories to scan recursively for MKV files.
# You can add multiple paths, including network paths.
media_dirs = ["/anime"]


# === Audio Operation Mode ===
# Determines how the selected audio track will be flagged in the MKV:
# - 'default' = Sets the chosen track as default (recommended for most players)
# - 'forced'  = Stronger flag; some players prioritize forced tracks
# - 'disable' = Disables all other non-selected tracks (optional cleanup)
# - 'enable'  = Re-enables tracks previously disabled (used to undo 'disable')
#
# Recommended: ["default"]
# Sets the best-scoring audio track as default, but leaves all others enabled.
# Keeps English dubs available for dual-audio use. Do NOT use "disable" if you want
# to switch audio tracks in your player (e.g., Japanese â†” English).
audio_mode = ["default"]


# === Subtitle Operation Mode ===
# Similar to audio_mode, this controls subtitle flags:
# - 'default' = Sets the preferred subtitle as the default track
# - 'forced'  = Additionally flags it as "forced" so players will display it automatically
#
# Recommended: ['default', 'forced']
# This helps ensure subtitles are shown even if the player isn't configured properly.
subtitle_mode = ["default", "forced"]


# === Audio Language Preferences ===
# Language ranking for audio tracks. Higher values are better.
# Default: prioritize Japanese audio, with English dubs as a fallback.
[audio_languages]
jpn = 120 # Preferred: Japanese audio
eng = 90  # Acceptable fallback: English dubs


# === Audio Codec Priorities ===
# Score audio codecs by quality. Higher values are better.
# This helps pick higher fidelity audio when multiple options exist.
[audio_codecs]
DTS-HD.MA = 10
TrueHD = 9
FLAC = 8
DTS = 7
EAC3 = 6
AC3 = 5
AAC = 4

# === Audio Channel Priorities ===
# Prefer audio with more channels (e.g. 5.1 surround over stereo).
# Key = number of channels, Value = priority score.
[audio_channels]
8 = 9
7 = 8
6 = 10 # Prefer 5.1 audio
5 = 7
4 = 6
3 = 5

# === Subtitle Language Preferences ===
# Rank subtitle languages by preference.
# 'und' = undefined language, treated as a fallback.
[subtitle_languages]

jpn = 150 # Japanese subs can be useful (e.g. signs for learning)
und = 30  # Use if no language is tagged


# === Track Filters (Subtitle Naming Heuristics) ===
# Looks at the track *name* to detect its purpose and assign priority.
# This is especially useful when language or codec alone isn't enough.
#
# Positive values = preferred types of subtitles (dialogue)
# Slightly positive = acceptable types (signs/songs)
# Negative values = unwanted tracks (commentary, SDH, lyrics, etc.)
#
# This section helps distinguish:
# - Full/dialogue subs (for watching in Japanese)
# - Signs & songs subs (for English dubs)
# - Commentary/SDH tracks (which should be ranked last)
[track_filters]

# Signs/songs tracks are *valid*, but lower priority than full subs
sign = 2

# Clearly unwanted types

# === Subtitle Codec Preferences ===
# Ranks subtitle formats by display quality and stylability.
# ASS (SubStationAlpha) is preferred for anime due to typesetting/styling.
[subtitle_codecs]
SubStationAlpha = 2 # Preferred: stylized subtitles (ASS/SSA)
"SubRip/SRT" = 1    # OK: plain subtitles
