# MKVPriority - MKV Track Prioritizer

**MKVPriority** assigns configurable priority scores to audio and subtitle tracks, similar to custom formats in Radarr/Sonarr. MKV flags, such as default and forced, are automatically set for the highest-priority tracks (e.g., 5.1 surround and ASS subtitles), while lower-priority tracks (e.g., stereo audio and PGS subtitles) are deprioritized.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> MKVPriority modifies track flags in place using `mkvpropedit` (**no remuxing**), allowing media players to automatically select the best audio and subtitle tracks according to your preferences.

## Features

- Assigns **configurable priority scores** to audio and subtitle tracks (similar to **custom formats** in Radarr/Sonarr)
- Automatically sets **default/forced flags** for the highest priority tracks (e.g., Japanese audio and ASS subtitles)
- Deprioritizes **unwanted audio and subtitle tracks** (e.g., English dubs, commentary tracks, signs/songs)
- Periodically scans your media library and processes new MKV files when using a **cron schedule** with a database
- Integrates with Radarr and Sonarr using a **custom script** to process new MKV files as they are imported

## CLI Usage

[`mkvtoolnix`](https://mkvtoolnix.download/) must be installed on your system for `mkvpropedit` (unless you are using the Docker image).

```text
usage: mkvpriority [-h] [-c TOML_PATH[::TAG]] [-a DB_PATH] [-v] [-x] [-q] [-p] [-r] [-n] [INPUT_PATH[::TAG] ...]

positional arguments:
  INPUT_PATH[::TAG]     files or directories

options:
  -c TOML_PATH[::TAG], --config TOML_PATH[::TAG]
  -a DB_PATH, --archive DB_PATH
  -v, --verbose         print track information
  -x, --debug           show mkvtoolnix results
  -q, --quiet           suppress logging output
  -p, --prune           prune database entries
  -r, --restore         restore original flags
  -n, --dry-run         leave tracks unchanged
```

## Docker Image

A Docker image is provided to simplify the installation process and enable quick deployment.

```bash
docker run --rm -v /path/to/media:/media ghcr.io/kennethsible/mkvpriority /media
```

### Use a Custom Config

You can specify your own preferences by creating a custom TOML config that defines track filters by name and assigns scores by property. To override the default config, use a bind mount:

```bash
docker run --rm -u ${PUID}:${PGID} \
  -v /path/to/media:/media \
  -v /path/to/mkvpriority/config:/config \
  ghcr.io/kennethsible/mkvpriority /media \
  --config /config/custom.toml
```

### Use an Archive Database

You can periodically process your media library using a cron job and an archive database. To keep track of processed files, create an `archive.db` file and use a bind mount:

```bash
docker run --rm -u ${PUID}:${PGID} \
  -v /path/to/media:/media \
  -v /path/to/mkvpriority/config:/config \
  ghcr.io/kennethsible/mkvpriority /media \
  --archive /config/archive.db
```

## Radarr/Sonarr Integration

You can process new MKV files as they are imported into Radarr/Sonarr by adding the custom script `mkvpriority.sh` and selecting 'On File Import' and 'On File Upgrade'. In order for Radarr/Sonarr to recognize the custom script, it must be visible inside the container.

> [!NOTE]
> To add a custom script to Radarr/Sonarr, go to Settings > Connect > Add Connection > Custom Script.

```yaml
mkvpriority:
  image: ghcr.io/kennethsible/mkvpriority
  container_name: mkvpriority
  user: ${PUID}:${PGID}
  environment:
    WEBHOOK_RECEIVER: "true"
    MKVPRIORITY_ARGS: >
      --archive /config/archive.db
  volumes:
    - /path/to/media:/media
    - /path/to/mkvpriority/config:/config
  restart: unless-stopped
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are not using "mkvpriority" as the name of your container, you will need to update it in the custom script.
> Also, verify that the mount point for your media directory in MKVPriority is the same as the one used by Radarr/Sonarr.

### Use Multiple Configs

MKVPriority supports multiple, tag-based configs that can be customized to match the tagging system used in Radarr/Sonarr. For example, you can create a separate config for anime by adding an `anime` tag in Radarr/Sonarr either manually or via auto-tagging. Then, append the `::anime` tag to the config path in the MKVPriority arguments.

```yaml
mkvpriority:
  image: ghcr.io/kennethsible/mkvpriority
  container_name: mkvpriority
  user: ${PUID}:${PGID}
  environment:
    WEBHOOK_RECEIVER: "true"
    MKVPRIORITY_ARGS: >
      --config /config/anime.toml::anime
      --archive /config/archive.db
  volumes:
    - /path/to/media:/media
    - /path/to/mkvpriority/config:/config
  restart: unless-stopped
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In Radarr/Sonarr, a given movie or show can have multiple tags. However, MKVPriority only uses the first tag in alphabetical order. Therefore, you may need to create new tags specifically for MKVPriority.

### Original Audio Language

MKVPriority supports using the Radarr/Sonarr API to identify the original language of a movie or series. You can assign priority scores to the language code `org` (original) by configuring API access with environment variables.

```yaml
mkvpriority:
  image: ghcr.io/kennethsible/mkvpriority
  container_name: mkvpriority
  user: ${PUID}:${PGID}
  environment:
    WEBHOOK_RECEIVER: "true"
    MKVPRIORITY_ARGS: >
      --archive /config/archive.db
    SONARR_URL: http://sonarr:8989
    SONARR_API_KEY: ${SONARR_API_KEY}
    RADARR_URL: http://radarr:7878
    RADARR_API_KEY: ${RADARR_API_KEY}
  volumes:
    - /path/to/media:/media
    - /path/to/mkvpriority/config:/config
  restart: unless-stopped
```

> [!NOTE]
> To generate an API key for Radarr/Sonarr, go to Settings > General > Security > API Key.

## Cron Scheduler

You can use the built-in cron scheduler to periodically scan your media library and process MKV files. When paired with an archive database, MKVPriority will only process new files with each scan.

```yaml
mkvpriority:
  image: ghcr.io/kennethsible/mkvpriority
  container_name: mkvpriority
  user: ${PUID}:${PGID}
  environment:
    TZ: "America/New_York"
    CRON_SCHEDULE: "0 5 * * *"
    MKVPRIORITY_ARGS: -a /config/archive.db /media
  volumes:
    - /path/to/media:/media
    - /path/to/mkvpriority/config:/config
  restart: unless-stopped
```

## TOML Configuration

A single TOML file controls all behavior by assigning priority scores to track properties, such as languages and codecs, and by defining custom filters for track names, such as signs and songs.

### Example: Subtitle Codecs

```toml
[subtitle_codecs]
"S_TEXT/ASS" = 2    # Stylized Subtitles (Advanced SubStationAlpha)
S_SSA = 2           # Legacy Stylized Subtitles (SubStationAlpha)
"S_TEXT/UTF8" = 1   # Plain Text Subtitles (SubRip/SRT)
"S_TEXT/WEBVTT" = 1 # Web-Based Video Text (Used in Streaming)
"S_HDMV/PGS" = 0    # Image-Based (Used in Blu-rays)
S_VOBSUB = 0        # Legacy Image-Based (Used in DVDs)
```

## Limitations

MKVPriority avoids remuxing by using `mkvpropedit`, but this still affects [hardlinks](https://trash-guides.info/File-and-Folder-Structure/Hardlinks-and-Instant-Moves/) since the metadata is modified.

## Acknowledgments

I've been using the excellent script from [TheCaptain989/radarr-striptracks](https://github.com/TheCaptain989/radarr-striptracks) to remove unwanted audio and subtitle tracks. However, I've always wanted a solution that automatically sets my preferred tracks as default/forced and doesn't require remuxing. After searching GitHub, I found an unmaintained project ([Andy2244/subby](https://github.com/Andy2244/subby)) that I decided to revive and package into a Docker image.
